Raphael,

Your hackathon project is great!
Your code is clean, readable, and very well structured. You've also done a good job using comments to make your code more understandable — well done.

However, there are several key topics missing from your project.
You didn't follow the project structure we learned in class, and you didn’t implement a database.

Try to be more ambitious next time so your project can reflect all the skills you’ve learned and come across as more professional and complete.

Keep up the effort!
